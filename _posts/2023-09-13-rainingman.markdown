title: Raining Man (2023)
description:
  - line: I went to Burning Man for the first time this year, and (as you may know, since it was so well dramatized by our media) we were rained out. That was kind of a bummer, but, yanno, shit happens. I kinda wish I had brought my gear with me when I went, so that I could have put together this set on the playa, rather than later at home. But it's still entirely inspired by the unexpectedly wet desert weather.
  - line: It was hard to dance in the mud, so I didn’t want it to be explicitly dance heavy. But I wanted something light to break up the silence. This is the set I needed to hear.
  - line: I selected tracks having to do with water or weather - rain, rivers, flood, clouds, sun - either in the track title or performer's name. The especially fun part was that I had never played most of the tracks I ultimately used, tho they were in my library. In fact, only two tracks had preset cue points (Rain on Me, and Let the Sun Shine), which is frankly why I let the tracks run through to their ends so often. It genre hops wildly. It’s a very lazy mix, if I’m being completely honest. Even still, I think it communicates a lot of complex emotion. And I think it would have been well received by a bunch of unexpectedly wet desert party people.
  - line: I was pleased with how it came out, so I decided to share it.
