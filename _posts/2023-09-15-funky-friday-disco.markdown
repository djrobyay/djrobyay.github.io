description:
  - line: Working on the Raining Man set got me excited, but it was a pretty lazy set - I barely even mixed any of the tracks together. So I really wanted to do something that could actually show what I could do.
  - line: With this set, I was experimenting with a bunch of new tracks that I hadn’t played with at all. Like the Raining Man set, most of the tracks had no cue points, so I was kinda jazzing it up.
