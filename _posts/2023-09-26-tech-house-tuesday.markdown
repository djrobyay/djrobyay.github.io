title: Tech House Tuesday (2023-09-26)
description:
  - line: Emboldened by the work I’d done in recent days, I kept creating. I really wanted to try playing with tracks that I think of as more "later in the night" - less fully vocal and traditionally instrumental, more vocal samples and electronic instrumentals - if only to prove to myself that I could mix something that wasn’t big girl diva house.
  - line: I think a lot of these tracks still push up against that big girl diva line, but it’s much more of a techy feel than I usually find myself playing. I like it. I want to do more like this!
