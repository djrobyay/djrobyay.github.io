title: Soul Searching Thursday (2023-09-28)
description:
  - line: Three sets in one week. I was feeling so fucking good about myself!
  - line: I set myself a goal of posting 80 hours of sets to Mixcloud before I would start really pushing myself hard onto people. I reasoned this amount of content based on Mixcloud's "maximum three plays in fourteen days" policy for free users.. I want people to be able to play me on a constant loop, unrestricted! I was really driving myself hard toward that goal, this week!
