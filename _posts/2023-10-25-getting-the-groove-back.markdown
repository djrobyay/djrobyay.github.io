title: Getting the Groove Back (2023-10-25)
description:
  - line: Three sets in one week. I really was feeling good about myself! I thought that shit was gonna keep up, and I'd end up hitting my goal of 80 hours of content within a month!
  - line: But, yanno.. that's not really what happened.
  - line: Whether because I felt burned out after doing so much in September, or because I got lazy, or whatever, I just wasn't feeling up to it for around a month. I kept experimenting with new tracks, but nothing really excited me.
  - line: This set, however, felt really great. I am SO FUCKING IN LOVE with Suki Soul. Every single time I hear Wear it Out, I feel happy.
