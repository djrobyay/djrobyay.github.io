description:
  - line: "So this is pretty exciting: this was my very first time performing live in front of strangers."
  - line: "The event was organized by the folks who started teaching me how to work with moden DJ equipment and software, and featured other graduates of the program."
  - line: "Unfortunately, I had only thirty minutes. And I was getting on an airplane first thing the next morning, to go hear my friend <a href='https://dylandrazen.com/'>Dylan Drazen</a> spin a fierce classic 90s house set in Fort Lauderdale, so I couldn't even stay to hear everyone play."
  - line: "But... that was fucking addictive! It's a damn shame I had such a short time slot! I could have played for hours."
  - line: "Extra special thanks to Diesel, Hannah, Suwasit, and Tiffany for coming out and supporting me at my very first performance! It meant fucking everything to me."
