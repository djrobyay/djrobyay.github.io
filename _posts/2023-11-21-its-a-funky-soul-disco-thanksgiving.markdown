description:
  - line: I came back from Fort Lauderdale with a whole new set of skills. [Dylan](https://dylandrazen.com/) spent several hours with me, showing me the processes and techniques he uses. I was very excited to learn that we did a lot of things similarly - it was exciting because nobody specifically *taught me* to do things that way... I just was... so it was kinda cool to learn that I instinctively did things similar to how someone with 30 years of experience does it.
  - line: I feel like my transitions really started maturing with this set. Probably the biggest issue remaining now (other than rushing like a seventeen year old having sex for the first time) is that I'm still really learning my music library, so my sequencing is pretty much random. Once I start thoughtfully and carefully planning out sets, this shit'll be insane.
