description:
  - line: I came back from Fort Lauderdale with a whole new set of skills. <a href="https://dylandrazen.com/">Dylan</a> spent several hours with me, showing me the processes and techniques he uses. I was very excited to learn that we did a lot of things similarly - it was exciting because nobody specifically <i>taught me</i> to do things the way I did... so it was kinda cool to learn that I instinctively did things similar to how someone with 30 years of experience does it.
  - line: I feel like my transitions really started maturing with this set. Probably the biggest issue remaining now (other than rushing like a seventeen year old having sex for the first time - which is why it took me four tries to get through this set without making any painful errors!) is that I’m still really learning my music library, so my sequencing is pretty much random. Once I start thoughtfully and carefully planning out sets, this shit’ll be insane.
