description:
  - line: So, a buddy of mine asked me to put together a groovy 'Motown-inspired' playlist for him, and I was like, 'Hell yeah, let's do this!' He threw out some legendary names like The Temptations, Marvin Gaye, Gladys Knight, and Earth Wind & Fire. I was excited to take on a different kind of challenge, but then I started to feel a bit anxious as I curated the tracks. You see, old Motown jams don't quite follow the same rules as modern tunes, and there aren't many intros or outros to work with. Plus, they're often super recognizable from the very first beat (take: 'I Heard it Through the Grapevine'). But I think I've got a decent first pass here. Gonna have him check it out and see if it meets what he had in mind. If you like this, stay tuned for more like it to come.
