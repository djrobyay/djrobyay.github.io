description:
  - line: "As a child of the 70s and 80s, I have always been drawn to the soulful sounds of the 60s and 70s. The raw emotion, the groovy beats, and the powerful lyrics of these tracks have always inspired me, and they shape the way I make music today."
  - line: "In this collection of sets, I spin some of my favorite soul tracks from the 60s and 70s that have been a constant source of motivation and inspiration for me. From the smooth, sultry sounds of Marvin Gaye and Aretha Franklin, to the funky, upbeat grooves of James Brown, these tracks have been a driving force behind my own musical history."
  - line: "So come on and join me on a journey through the sounds of the past, and let's see where the music takes us!"
