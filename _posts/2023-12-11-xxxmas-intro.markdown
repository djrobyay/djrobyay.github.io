description:
  - line: "If you know me, you'll know that I'm not exactly a xxxmas music enthusiast (to put it delicately), but I was asked by some friends if I could prepare a set for the holiday season. I took it as another opportunity to showcase the diversity of my musical tastes."
  - line: "I rummaged through an extensive collection of tracks and handpicked a little more than a hundred that I think tell a fun and personal story. While some may be more obvious choices, a majority were new discoveries (or, more fun: rediscoveries) for me. However, they all share a common thread that reflects my musical preferences and journey. If you listen closely, you might just be able to decipher a tale about me hidden within the tracks."
  - line: "I'm excited to share this xxxmas set with you. I'm planning to break it into a few parts to keep things interesting (and to follow Mixcloud posting rules!). Each set will take a different path through my musical journey, so stay tuned for more! This is just a taste of what's to come."
