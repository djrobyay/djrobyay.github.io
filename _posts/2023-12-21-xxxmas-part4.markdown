title: "Feeling Like a Little Bit of Funky, Funky xxxmas, Part 4 (2023-12-21)"
description:
  - line: "Welcome to the fourth and final installment of my funky, soulful, and disco-inspired xxxmas sets! It's been a great pleasure sharing these tracks with you, and I hope they've brought a little bit of joy and festivity to your holiday season."
  - line: "The final track on this playlist really pushed my emotional buttons a bit as I listened to it. Judy... she just made me feel all the feels. I hope it has a similar (if also gentler) effect on you, and that it brings a sense of peace and hope to your holiday season (cuz that's really what I'm trying to find in it!)."
  - line: "Thank you again for being a part of my community, and for allowing me to share my love of music with you. And thank you for letting me share the season with you in this very special way, even from very far away. I hope you have a wonderful holiday season, and a happy and healthy new year."
